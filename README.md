Mood Playlist Generator
Welcome to the Mood Playlist Generator—a sonic slot machine that hurls YouTube playlists or rogue videos at you based on whatever emotional dumpster fire you’re currently stoking.  
Overview
This deranged contraption sniffs out your mood—be it a puddle of weepy despair or a cackling cyclone of manic energy—and conjures a playlist or video to match. No logic, no mercy, just vibes.  
Features
Mood Detection Chaos: Spits out a random YouTube playlist or single video based on your unhinged emotional state.  

Tear-Soaked Compatibility: Perfect for when you’re a sobbing mess contemplating the void.  

Frenzy-Ready: Equally adept at fueling your caffeine-fueled rampages.  

Zero Predictability: Like a musical fever dream, it’s anyone’s guess what you’ll get.
Installation
Locate a device that hasn’t been smashed in a fit of rage.  

Clone this repo: git clone [whatever-the-heck-this-URL-is]  

Install dependencies (assuming this thing needs any): npm install or pip install or just scream into the void.  

Run it: node moodGenerator.js or whatever incantation works.  

Brace yourself.
Usage
Stare into the abyss and decide your mood (e.g., “tragic swamp goblin” or “hyperactive gremlin”).  

Feed your emotional wreckage into the generator (probably via a dropdown or a primal scream).  

Watch as it barfs out a YouTube link or playlist tailored to your chaos.  

Press play and let the madness wash over you.
Example
Input Mood: “Crying into my cereal about taxes”  

Output: A 3-hour playlist of sad banjo covers and a video of a raccoon staring into your soul.  

Input Mood: “Bouncing off walls after 17 espressos”  

Output: A single 10-minute clip of a guy yelling over techno beats.
